### Poem on the laziness of a bachelor guy generated by ChatGPT - An AI model

In a realm of leisure, where time stands still,
Resides a bachelor, of laziness his will.
With unkempt hair and rumpled attire,
He navigates life with a lackadaisical desire.

The morning sun rises, yet he remains in bed,
Dreaming of adventures within his own head.
Unburdened by commitments, no schedule to obey,
He savors the luxury of an idle day.

The dishes pile high, unwashed and ignored,
The vacuum gathers dust, its duty deplored.
Clothes lie scattered, a chaotic mess,
As he lounges on the couch, his laziness to confess.

The world outside beckons, with its vibrant array,
But he's content in his den, where laziness holds sway.
Responsibilities evade him, like a cunning game,
As he revels in the bachelor's carefree name.

Yet deep within his heart, a flicker resides,
A desire for purpose that subtly guides.
For in the depths of his lazy retreat,
A longing stirs, a sense of incompleteness.

One day, perhaps, he'll rise from his slumber,
Embrace the world, its challenges to encumber.
No longer a slave to indolence's charms,
He'll seize the day with determined arms.

Until then, the bachelor lives at his own pace,
Finding solace in the realms of laziness' embrace.
A whimsical existence, in a realm of his own,
Till the day he discovers the seeds to be sown.

So let him be, this bachelor guy,
For laziness, too, can teach us why
A pause in life's rush, a moment of rest,
May lead to insights, to what truly is best.
